#### ðŸš€ The Meaning of "Custos Clarus"

"Custos Clarus" translates to "Guardian Clear" in Latin. In the realm of cybersecurity, I embody the role of a clear and vigilant guardian, dedicated to securing digital landscapes.

#### ðŸ”­ Current Work

I'm currently working as a Cyber Security Consultant for a Swiss IT-based security company, passionately spending my time in the offensive security trenches. I thrive on the thrill of battling through certifications like PNPT, OSCP, and a variety of other exciting credentials. My role involves delivering top-notch IT security services, specializing in implementing technologies such as PAM, SIEM, DLP, and IAM across various deployment scenarios, both on-premise and in the cloud.

#### ðŸŒ± Learning Journey

I began my career in 2008, just a year after graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. My initial role was as an Information Security Engineer for a large defense system integrator organization. Subsequently, I transitioned to working for a government agency responsible for the World's Largest Biometric Citizen Database, where I played a pivotal role in establishing the first SOC/SIEM platform.

After resigning, between 2010 and 2023, I gained diverse experience in nearly every significant cybersecurity domain, including architecture, design, SDLC (Agile Scrum Master), ethical hacking, security audit, and compliance. My passion lies in building my GitHub repository as a collection of tools, gadgets, and code that provide mindful security rather than simply reinventing the wheel.
